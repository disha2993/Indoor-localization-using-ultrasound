# Indoor-localization-using-ultrasound
The aim of this project is to track any object inside the building using the ultrasonic transmitter and receivers. It is like an indoor GPS system. The project uses an RF module for synchronization of signals.
•	The system uses 2 pairs of ultrasonic speakers to transmit the signal on sync reception and a microphone that is placed on the mobile device, which receives these signals.
•	Designed the circuit for the mobile device and built the code to detect the ultrasound pulses and determine the coordinates of the device using Trilateration method and display them on an LCD display.
